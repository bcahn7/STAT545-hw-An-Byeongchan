## Report my progress

I tried to use dplyr to manipulate and explore data and ggplot2 to visualize the results. I tried to apply many of fucntions taught in class. Doing the homework I had some troubles.  
  
I realized that when using `spread()`, I lose the column headers for "key" and "value". It would be good to indicate what the values are as the "value" header disappears.
